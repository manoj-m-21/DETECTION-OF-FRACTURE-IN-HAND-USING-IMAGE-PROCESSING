        Avoid Repetitive Strain: If your work or hobbies involve repetitive hand movements, take frequent breaks to reduce the risk of overuse injuries.

        Exercise and Strengthen: Regularly perform hand and wrist exercises to strengthen the muscles and improve flexibility. This can help prevent fractures.

        Use Proper Technique: When lifting heavy objects or performing tasks that involve force, use proper lifting techniques and body mechanics to reduce strain on your hands and wrists.

        Be Cautious on Slippery Surfaces: Be cautious when walking on slippery surfaces, especially during wet or icy conditions. Use handrails and maintain balance to prevent falls.""",

        """Proper Fist Techniques: If you're involved in martial arts or self-defense training, ensure you're using proper fist techniques to minimize the risk of hand fractures during strikes.

        Ergonomic Workstation: If you work at a computer, maintain an ergonomic workstation with an appropriately positioned keyboard and mouse. This can reduce the risk of repetitive stress injuries in the hands and wrists.

        Avoid Hand Fatigue: Be mindful of hand fatigue during tasks that require prolonged gripping or fine motor skills. Take breaks and stretch your hands and fingers.

        Warm-Up Exercises: Before engaging in physically demanding activities or sports, perform warm-up exercises specifically targeting your hands and wrists to prepare them for action.

        Wrist Support: Consider wearing wrist supports or braces if you have a history of hand or wrist injuries. These can provide added stability and protection.""",

        Avoid Excessive Force: Be cautious when using hand tools or machinery. Avoid excessive force, and make sure you're using the correct tools for the task.

        Proper Handwashing: Practicing good hand hygiene, including proper handwashing techniques, can help prevent infections that might lead to complications and hand injuries.

        Safety in the Kitchen: Use caution in the kitchen to avoid cuts and burns. Always handle knives and hot cookware with care.

        Nutrition: Maintain a balanced diet rich in calcium and other essential nutrients that support bone health. Strong bones are less prone to fractures.

        Hand Therapy and Rehabilitation: Seek the guidance of a hand therapist or occupational therapist who specializes in hand injuries. They can design a personalized rehabilitation program to improve hand strength, flexibility, and function during recovery.

        Splint and Support: Follow your doctor's advice on wearing a splint or brace to immobilize the fractured hand. Wearing it consistently and as recommended can help promote proper healing.

        Active Finger Exercises: While your hand is in a splint or cast, perform gentle finger exercises daily to maintain finger mobility. These exercises may include making circles with each finger or tapping your fingertips together.""",
